## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: crypto battle arena 
- **Category**: gaming

### Description

Crypto Battle Arena is a decentralized battle game where players own characters as NFTs.
Characters level up by spending cryptocurrency (ETH, SUI, or stablecoins).
Higher levels → higher rarity, higher in-game value, and stronger stats.
As they level up, characters unlock special abilities:
Custom costumes (NFT skins)
Weapon power-ups (stronger attacks, unique styles)
Special abilities (rare skills only available at higher tiers)

### SL Integration  
Use Soundness Layer to verify battle results and randomness 
Level-up actions create proofs stored in Walrus to ensure all progression is transparent.
Cross-chain token support → players can spend ETH/SUI/USDC to upgrade

## Technical

Frontend: Web-based battle arena for players to connect wallets and play.
Game Engine: Web3-connected battle logic with ZK proofs for fairness.
Smart Contracts: NFT ownership, leveling, ability unlocks, marketplace.
